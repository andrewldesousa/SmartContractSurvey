# SmartContractSurvey
Research and data serves as a guide in developing products and conducting market research. This is only possible if we can fully rely on the integrity of data we use to carry out these processes. The telos of the Smart Contract Survey application is to enable data collection/generation with complete privacy and anonymization of data via the process of users taking surveys.
