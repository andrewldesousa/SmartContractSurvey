# SmartContractSurvey
We believe – even more so in the era of fake news – that research and facts should be our guiding lights. This is only possible if we can fully rely on their integrity. Especially, with modern technology undermining the integrity of research and spreading wrong messages has never been easier before. Therefore, our mission is to help rigorously conducted research to leave no doubt about its integrity.

## Running the  Application
To run this app, you will need a recent version of Node.js and MongoDB. This repository include both the front end and the backend for the application. Before running the application, MongoDB should be running on your PC. If you haven't installed the dependencies, you must run `npm install` while being in the same directory as package.json. Note: both the frontend and the backend have independent `package.json` files.

### Development
For the frontend run these commands...
```
cd app
npm install
npm run start
```

For the backend, run these commands... 
```
cd backend
npm install
node app.js
```

### Production
